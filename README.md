This is a p5.js program that generates blocks, with an UI.

Definition: a “block” is a 3x3 matrix made up of 0 or 1.

To visualize these squares, we say 0=small black square, and 1=small white square.

The objective of this code is to generate the completeness of these blocks and classify them.

Block format (example): [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,0,0]].

We have some filters on blocks. A "continuous" or "connected" block is a block in which all "1" are connected, but not in diagonal.
A "broken" block is a block which is not continuous.
Then there is the pattern filters. You can try to check the pattern filters and guess for yourself what the patterns are.

There is also the Processing version, in BlocGenerator.pde.
